# Ram — History

## Project Context

- **Project:** ElBruno.MCPToolRouter
- **User:** Bruno Capuano
- **Stack:** .NET (C#), NuGet library, xUnit, ElBruno.LocalEmbeddings
- **Description:** .NET library that ingests MCP tool definitions, embeds them into a local vector store, and returns top-K most relevant tools via cosine similarity.

## Learnings

- Created comprehensive README.md following exact ElBruno .NET conventions: badges, tagline, packages table, installation, quick start example, and author/acknowledgments sections
- Established MIT LICENSE with "Copyright (c) 2026 Bruno Capuano"
- Set up CI Build workflow (build.yml) with ubuntu-latest runner, SDK 8.0.x, multi-target compilation strategy
- Set up Publish workflow (publish.yml) with OIDC trusted publishing (no API key secrets), version extraction from tags/inputs, and per-project packing for MCPToolRouter
- images/ directory already existed; nuget_logo.png to be added manually by Bruno
- All workflows use solution-level operations against ElBruno.ModelContextProtocol.slnx as per conventions
